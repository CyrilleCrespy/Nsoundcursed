nsoundcursed is a tool made on my free time, mostly for my personal benefit.
It is protected by the GPL 2.0 licence and only that specific version, as others files clearly states.

The goal is this software is to provide a lightweight and terminal based tool,
to launch sounds as requested by the user, while providing a list of all songs available.

It uses ncurses (with the menu library) for the display, vlc (in the form of cvlc)
to launch the audio and a standard C library implementation (it was tested
with glibc only at current time), please feel free to try with musl or whatever.
The library libmagic, usually provided by file, is also a request.

Translations use gettext tools. I personnally took great advantage of this document
to make it work : https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/posts/programming/a-quick-gettext-tutorial.html

Currently, the project relies on the GNU toolchain, with make and gcc.
It was tested only on Linux. Again, if you wanna try to test or adapt it,
wether for any BSD, Hurd or whatever, then feel free to contribute.
